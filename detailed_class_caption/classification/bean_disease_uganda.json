  "angular_leaf_spot": "The common bean, *Phaseolus vulgaris*, a member of the Fabaceae family, is a herbaceous annual cultivated globally for its protein-rich seeds and pods. Morphologically, it exhibits determinate (bush) or indeterminate (pole) growth habits, with trifoliate compound leaves composed of ovate leaflets. In a state of health, these leaves are uniformly green, with a smooth texture and vibrant appearance, supported by a sturdy stem. The plant thrives in well-drained loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and requires full sun and consistent moisture. Its ecological importance lies in its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria, enabling nitrogen fixation. However, the plant is susceptible to angular leaf spot, a fungal disease caused by *Phaeoisariopsis griseola*. The pathogen, which overwinters in seed and crop debris, produces conidia that are dispersed by wind and rain splash. Infection is favored by moderate temperatures and high humidity. The disease manifests as distinct, angular lesions on the leaves, sharply delineated by the leaf veins. These lesions, initially gray or brown, may be encircled by a chlorotic halo. As the disease progresses, the necrotic tissue within the lesions can dry and fall out, creating a ‘shot-hole’ or tattered appearance on the foliage. This pathogenesis disrupts the leaf's photosynthetic capacity, leading to reduced vigor and yield. Unlike the smooth, intact surface of a healthy leaf, the infected leaf exhibits a rough, uneven texture and a mottled coloration of green, yellow, and necrotic brown, signifying a significant deviation from its normal physiological and morphological state.",
  "bean_rust": "The common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris*), a versatile legume in the Fabaceae family, is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which, in a healthy specimen, are uniformly green, smooth-surfaced, and exhibit vigorous growth. The plant's morphology varies between bush types, which are compact, and pole types, which are vining. It prefers warm climates and well-aerated soil, contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Bean rust, caused by the pathogenic fungus *Uromyces appendiculatus*, significantly alters this healthy state. This obligate parasite has a complex life cycle, often completed on the bean plant itself, and is characterized by the production of several spore types. The disease cycle begins when wind-borne urediniospores land on a susceptible host plant under conditions of high humidity and moderate temperatures. The initial symptoms appear on the undersides of the leaves as small, whitish, slightly raised spots. These spots enlarge and develop into the characteristic reddish-brown, rust-like pustules, known as uredinia, which are about 1-2 mm in diameter. These pustules rupture the leaf epidermis, releasing a powdery mass of urediniospores that can initiate secondary infections. A distinct yellow halo often surrounds the pustules. In severe infections, the pustules can coalesce, covering large areas of the leaf surface and also appearing on pods and stems. The infected leaves lose their smooth texture, becoming bumpy and rough. The normal green color is disrupted by the reddish-brown pustules and surrounding chlorotic tissue. This widespread infection impairs photosynthesis and increases water loss, causing infected leaves to turn yellow, dry out, and drop prematurely, ultimately leading to significant yield reduction and diminished plant vitality.",
  "healthy": "A healthy specimen of the common bean, *Phaseolus vulgaris*, a member of the Fabaceae family, represents the pinnacle of its botanical potential. This herbaceous annual, which can be either a compact bush variety reaching heights of 20-60 cm or a climbing pole variety extending 2-3 meters, exhibits a robust and vigorous growth habit. Its taxonomy places it within a crucial group of nitrogen-fixing legumes, enhancing soil fertility. The morphology of a healthy plant is characterized by a strong, upright stem system that provides excellent support for its foliage. The leaves are trifoliate, with each of the three ovate leaflets displaying a smooth, uniform surface and a vibrant, rich green coloration, indicative of optimal chlorophyll production and photosynthetic efficiency. The leaf structure is perfectly formed, without any signs of discoloration, lesions, or textural abnormalities. The plant thrives in its natural habitat of well-drained, loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, and requires at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily. Ideal cultivation practices include consistent moisture, with approximately one inch of water per week, especially during the flowering and pod development stages. In this optimal state, the plant's physiology functions at its peak, leading to the production of numerous flowers, which are typically white, pink, or purple, and subsequently, well-formed, unblemished pods. The overall appearance is one of vitality and resilience, with a dense canopy of lush foliage that effectively captures sunlight, driving the energetic processes necessary for growth and the production of high-quality beans."
