  "healthy": "The healthy onion plant, Allium cepa, a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, represents the baseline of botanical vigor and optimal physiological condition. Taxonomically, it is a biennial herb, though typically cultivated as an annual. Its morphology is characterized by a very short, flattened stem at the base, from which adventitious, fibrous roots and leaves arise. The leaves are essential for diagnosis; in a healthy specimen, they are tubular, hollow, and distichous, presenting a uniform, deep green coloration. They stand erect and turgid, indicative of proper hydration and cellular integrity. A waxy cuticle on the leaf surface provides a glaucous appearance and serves as a protective barrier. Optimal growth is achieved in well-drained, fertile soils, such as sandy loams, with consistent moisture and high nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen and potassium. Full sun exposure for at least six hours daily is crucial for robust photosynthesis, which fuels the development of the subterranean bulb. Ecologically, onions are significant as a widely cultivated food source. A healthy plant is free of any spots, lesions, discoloration, or signs of stress. Its vitality is evident in the crisp texture of its leaves and the steady enlargement of the bulb, which is formed by the swelling of the concentric leaf bases. This ideal state is a testament to a favorable environment and the absence of pathological pressures, allowing the plant to complete its life cycle efficiently, producing a firm, well-sized bulb and, if allowed to overwinter, a tall, sturdy scape bearing a spherical umbel of greenish-white flowers.",
  "iris_yellow_virus": "Iris yellow spot, caused by the Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), presents a significant pathological deviation from the healthy botanical state of an onion plant (*Allium cepa*). IYSV is a tospovirus, belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, and its etiology is intrinsically linked to its vector, the onion thrips (*Thrips tabaci*). The virus is acquired by thrips larvae feeding on an infected host and is subsequently transmitted by adult thrips to healthy plants in a persistent and propagative manner. The infection cycle is heavily influenced by environmental factors that favor thrips populations, such as hot and dry conditions. The virus disrupts the plant's normal physiology, leading to a reduction in photosynthetic capacity, which ultimately impacts bulb size and overall yield. Visibly, the disease is characterized by distinct, diagnostic lesions on the leaves and scapes. These symptoms include yellowish to straw-colored, diamond-shaped lesions, which are particularly pronounced on the flower stalks. Lesions can also be elongated or appear as flecks and may exhibit concentric rings of alternating tan and green tissue. Green islands of tissue may sometimes persist within the necrotic spots. As the disease progresses, these lesions can coalesce, causing the leaves to become necrotic, wither, and collapse, a stark contrast to the firm, upright green leaves of a healthy specimen. Severely affected scapes may lodge, or fall over, significantly reducing seed production in crops grown for that purpose.",
  "leaf_blight": "Onion leaf blight, primarily caused by the fungal pathogen *Botrytis squamosa*, represents a significant disease that compromises the vitality and morphology of *Allium cepa*. This ascomycete fungus initiates a disease cycle by overwintering as sclerotia in soil or on infected plant debris and cull piles. In the spring, these sclerotia produce airborne spores (conidia), which serve as the primary inoculum. Infection is favored by cool to moderate temperatures (55°F to 75°F) and prolonged periods of leaf wetness from dew, rain, or overhead irrigation. The pathogen's biology involves the germination of spores on the leaf surface, followed by the production of enzymes that macerate and kill plant tissue. The visible symptoms starkly contrast with the appearance of a healthy plant. The initial signs are small, oval-shaped, whitish, and sunken spots on the leaves, typically measuring 0.5 to 6 mm in length. These lesions are often encircled by a characteristic greenish-white, water-soaked halo. As the disease progresses, the centers of these spots may become tan or grayish, and the lesions coalesce, leading to a blighted appearance. A key difference from a healthy, turgid leaf is the subsequent dieback of the leaf tips and, in severe cases, the collapse of the entire leaf structure. This loss of photosynthetic area directly impairs the plant's ability to produce energy, resulting in stunted bulb growth and reduced yields. The affected leaves lose their vibrant green color and crisp texture, becoming necrotic and dried out, showcasing a dramatic decline in plant vitality.",
  "purple_blotch": "Purple blotch, an impactful disease of *Allium cepa*, is caused by the necrotrophic fungus *Alternaria porri*. This pathogen alters the onion plant's healthy morphology through a distinct pathological progression. The disease's etiology begins with the fungus overwintering in infected crop residue on or near the soil surface. When environmental conditions become favorable, specifically warm temperatures ranging from 77-85°F and high humidity with extended periods of leaf wetness, the fungus produces conidia. These airborne spores are disseminated by wind and splashing rain, initiating infection, often through wounds on the leaf tissue created by mechanical damage or pests like thrips. The infection cycle involves the germination of these spores on the leaf surface, leading to the appearance of symptoms within one to four days. Initially, the visible symptoms manifest as small, sunken, water-soaked lesions with whitish or light-colored centers on the older, more susceptible leaves. Compared to the uniform green of a healthy leaf, these lesions rapidly enlarge and develop into the disease's namesake coloration: oval-shaped, purplish, or brown spots. A characteristic feature that distinguishes this disease is the presence of concentric, target-like rings within the lesions, which are often surrounded by a yellow halo extending along the leaf. As the fungus sporulates, the lesions may take on a dark, velvety appearance. The disease severely impacts the plant's physiology; the affected leaf tissue loses its turgidity, turns yellow or brown, and may eventually be girdled by the coalescing lesions, causing it to wilt and fold over. This destruction of foliage reduces photosynthetic capacity, leading to smaller, immature bulbs and significant yield loss."
